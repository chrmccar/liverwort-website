This is probably the commonest of the thallose liverworts in very dry habitats, and it is also quite common in wet regions. The solid but rather brittle thallus is 5 to 7 mm wide, and (except drier habitats) usually forked laterally into two or sometimes more tongue-like lobes. The 1orsal surface is usually green, but the margins and ventral surface (and also sometimes the dorsal surface) are distinctly crimson-black. When dry the thallus folds up along its length, and when it is quite dry only the dark, wavy edges of the ventral surface are exposed. The pseudoperianths, which hang from a tall archegoniophore, are each adorned with a frill of 12 to 14 white strips joined at the tips. When squashed, the thallus has an unusual fishy smell.
